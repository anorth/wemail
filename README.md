# weMail

Draft emails together.

## Setup

It all runs without a server. Marvel at the magic!

Run a lightweight web server, e.g.:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and open http://localhost:8000

(Note: firebase does not work with file:/// protocol addresses)

## Deployment

To deploy to https://wemail.firebaseapp.com:

    $ firebase deploy
